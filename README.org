* On the turing completeness of Python 3
  Certain rumors have been brewing about the fact that Python 3 is not Turing complete.
  I wanted to prove that that rumors are false.

  To prove that a computing system is Turing complete, one needs to show that is can emulate any Turing machine or any Turing complete computing system.

  My first goal was to rewrite Microsoft Powerpoint in Python 3, as it was shown that Powerpoint is Turing complete.
  This proved to be too great a task.

  I chose a more simple computing system, Brainfuck.
  This is a brainfuck interpreter written in Python 3, which proves its Turing completeness.
